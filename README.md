# Abstract

We have successfully developed a versatile audio search project that exhibits several desirable features. The algorithm is designed to be resilient against noise and distortion, ensuring accurate identification of short music segments captured via cellphone microphones. It can effectively handle the challenges posed by voice codec compression and operates efficiently on a vast scale, accommodating a database with over a million tracks. By utilizing a unique approach based on combinatorially hashed time-frequency constellation analysis of the audio, the algorithm offers remarkable characteristics, including transparency. This means that even when multiple tracks are mixed together, the engine can identify each individual track. Additionally, for applications such as radio monitoring, the search process is incredibly fast, deteting the songs added to the database; in our case, we added three songs to the database.
